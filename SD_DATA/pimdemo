Welcome to PIM! A text editor written in Python for Chip OS!
 
It's named after VIM, because PIM was designed to be somewhat like it, but it isn't a one-to-one copy.
 
PIM pretty much is just the basics:
  -Navigating the file
  -Editing the file
  -Line insertion and deletion
  -File reading/saving
 
It's pretty cool, though! It's WAYYYY better than the "write" and "addf" commands!
 
You can even write code in it too!
Paired with the "read" and "run" commands, this text editor is a beast!
